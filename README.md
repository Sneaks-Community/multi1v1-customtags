# Installation

Drag multi1v1_customtags.smx into your /plugins/ folder. Requires Multi-1v1 Arenas by splewis.

# Usage

Currently:  
VIP = custom2 flag  
Admin = b flag  
Owner = z flag

Yes, it's all hard-coded, no I will not offer support. An incredibly minimal amount of SP knowledge will allow you to modify/add anything you want inside here.

Got the idea from ESK0's Country Tag plugin here: https://github.com/ESK0/Multi1v1-CountryTag
